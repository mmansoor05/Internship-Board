# Internship-Board
The idea behind this is when I was applying to Summer 2022 internships, and I wanted to keep a list of all the internships where I applied. 
So, in this web app, you just have to select the company from drop down and then the date when you apply it and once you are done, you can download the complete 
list of internships.
